# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! This repository contains my personal solutions to the annual programming puzzles, solved using Python.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming competition created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released daily. Participants can solve these puzzles in any programming language, and each puzzle has two parts that build upon each other.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Python 3.13 used in this repository)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:JathinShyam/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install any required dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Solutions

Navigate to the specific day's directory and run the solution:

```bash
cd 2025/day1
python 1.py  # Run part 1
python 2.py  # Run part 2
```

Or run from the project root:

```bash
python 2025/day1/1.py
python 2025/day1/2.py
```


## Notes

- **Puzzle Inputs**: The `input.txt` files contain my personal puzzle inputs. Each participant receives unique inputs, so your results may differ.
- **Solutions**: These are my personal solutions and may not be the most optimized. They represent my learning journey and problem-solving approach.
- **Code Style**: Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness over optimization, though I do try to write clean, readable code.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Standard Libraries**: Collections, heapq, math, and other built-in modules
- **External Libraries**: Minimal dependencies (e.g., sortedcontainers when needed)

## Learning Goals

This repository serves as:
- Practice for algorithmic problem-solving
- Learning new Python features and techniques
- Building problem-solving skills
- Having fun with programming puzzles!
